## 4. Sector-Specific Challenges and Technological Trends

### 4.1 Femtech Funding Gap and Market Viability

Despite a global femtech market currently valued at approximately US$28 billion and expected to reach US$60 billion by 2027, industry reports (e.g., The Guardian) indicate that only 1–2% of global health tech funding is allocated to this niche. This discrepancy underscores a gap that female-led initiatives in health tech need to address. Funding programmes such as Invest NI’s gender-specific initiatives attempt to remedy this imbalance by providing targeted support that not only offers capital but also enhances mentorship and business development aspects.

### 4.2 Insurance and Risk Assessment Barriers

A survey by Tokio Marine Kiln (TMK) highlights significant insurance-related challenges for female health tech founders:

- **Difficulties Acquiring Insurance:** 76% of the respondents faced challenges, primarily due to prohibitive costs and process complexities.
- **Lack of Sector-Specific Expertise:** Approximately 39%–42% noted that brokers and underwriters often lack a sufficient understanding of the risks inherent to the health tech sector.

Responding to these challenges, TMK has introduced a bespoke insurance product integrating coverage for life sciences liability, cyber, and intellectual property (IP) risks. Additionally, AI-driven tools—such as predictive analytics in underwriting—are proving transformative in risk assessment processes. These technologies facilitate the integration of vast amounts of data from electronic health records and behavioral metrics, thereby enabling more customized iterated policies.

### 4.3 AI Integration in Underwriting and Operational Efficiency

Notably, AI technologies are revolutionizing traditional insurance underwriting through:

- **Automated Claims Processing:** Increasing operational efficiency and speed of service.
- **Real-time Risk Monitoring:** AI enables continuous risk assessments by fusing data from multiple sources, such as historical claims data, EHR, and behavioral metrics.
- **Fraud Detection and Digital Identity Verification:** Tools like LexisNexis® ThreatMetrix® provide comprehensive digital identity assessments using cross-industry data spanning over 200 countries.

The adoption of these AI-powered risk assessment models, as detailed in industry analyses including Scott Bolen’s insights on machine learning-based evaluations, is particularly advantageous for health tech startups. These innovations enhance the accuracy and scalability of underwriting, paving the way for more precise, risk-adjusted premium structuring.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics and Proposal Considerations for Digital Consent Technology

### 5.1 Metrics for Evaluating Health Tech Innovations

For projects centered on advanced digital consent systems, evaluation criteria often blend traditional business metrics with digital performance indicators. These include:

- **Time Savings:** Reduction in administrative burdens and improved patient onboarding processes.
- **Cost Reductions:** Economic impact through streamlined operations and enhanced data integration.
- **Patient Engagement:** Improved experiential and clinical outcomes as evidenced by key performance indicators (KPIs) covering engagement rates and satisfaction

Initiatives such as the Northern Ireland Life and Health Sciences Launchpad and HSC Innovations have integrated such metrics into their application frameworks. Although exact benchmarks may not always be specified, proposals are expected to articulate clear, quantifiable targets that reflect the anticipated impact of the technology.

### 5.2 Comparative Analysis of Programme Evaluation Approaches

Different programmes adopt varied emphases:

- **HSC Innovations:** Focuses on novelty, commercial viability, patentability, and robust legal assessments. Their evaluation framework incorporates a detailed assessment of intellectual property and long-term market potential.
- **NI Digital Health Technologies Accelerator:** Emphasizes a broader set of commercial and operational outcomes by facilitating direct pathways to market and integrating industry-specific metrics, such as digital user engagement and iterative technological improvement.

Such differentiated approaches suggest that while harmonizing evaluation metrics across programmes could be beneficial, the diversity of criteria allows applicants to tailor their proposals according to the specific foci of each fund.
