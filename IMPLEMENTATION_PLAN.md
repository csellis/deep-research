# Implementation Plan

## 1. Missing Sources

- [ ] Since adding Jina, the sources are not showing up.
 ```bash
 Error running query: "Local lifestyle and leisure activities
Error running query: "Long-term property price trends and prospects in Charlotte, NC vs Feering, Essex": Jina search fai
Generating final report...
```
- [ ] Difficult to debug if the sources are not showing up. Save the sources to the database for each report.
- [ ] Add the sources to the report page.
